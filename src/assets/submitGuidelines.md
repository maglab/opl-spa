# Guidelines for Writing a Good Open Problem

To ensure the quality and focus of open problems, particularly in the complex field of ageing, adhering to specific guidelines is crucial. Below is a detailed elaboration of each guideline to assist in crafting a well-defined open problem:

- **Specificity in Addressing Ageing**: Focus on a specific aspect of ageing to avoid overly broad questions. Narrowing down the scope invites targeted and meaningful contributions. For example, instead of a broad question on how ageing affects the human body, consider focusing on the impact of ageing on cognitive function.

- **Context or Background Definition**: Providing a clear context or background is essential. Explain the importance of the problem, summarize existing research, and highlight knowledge gaps. This helps potential contributors understand the significance and how their work can contribute.

- **Clarity in the Nature of the Enquiry**: Specify whether your question seeks qualitative insights, quantitative data, a comparative analysis, or predictive models. This guides researchers on the suitable methodology and approach for addressing the problem.

- **Relevance to Current Trends and Challenges**: Align your question with current trends and challenges in ageing research. It should address ongoing discussions, emerging technologies, or recent findings, ensuring the problem's practical implications for society and policy.

By following these guidelines, submissions will be well-defined, researchable, and impactful within the field of ageing studies.
