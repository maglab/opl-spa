# Unraveling the Mysteries of Aging: A Collaborative Journey

Despite considerable advances in understanding the biological underpinnings of longevity, many questions remain unanswered, highlighting the vast uncharted territories of aging research. Our initiative, "An online comprehensive compilation of open problems in longevity science," aims to illuminate these mysteries by fostering a collaborative environment where users can share insights, challenges, and controversies in the biology of aging.

## A Framework for Collective Inquiry

At the heart of our project lies the ambition to create a dynamic online platform dedicated to aggregating and curating the open questions that define the current landscape of aging and longevity research. By making this resource freely available, we aim to democratize access to information and empower individuals from diverse backgrounds to contribute to the discourse on aging.

## Charting the Course: The Technical Blueprint

The technical foundation of our project is based on developing a relational database that catalogues the myriad open problems, questions, and challenges pervasive in longevity science. An interactive interface will serve as the portal through which users can navigate this complex web of information, offering an unprecedented level of accessibility and engagement with the content. Our commitment to meticulous curation, relevance, accuracy, and the elimination of biases ensures that this platform will stand as a testament to the collective wisdom of the research community.

## The Path Forward: Milestones and Vision

Our timeline outlines a series of milestones that guide our progress from the initial literature review and community engagement to the culmination of a comprehensive online repository. The phased approach ensures a systematic compilation, curation, and annotation of the open questions in longevity science, underscored by a commitment to community feedback and collaborative improvement. A hybrid workshop and the publication of an open-access journal paper are envisioned as pivotal moments for consolidating community input and showcasing the results of our collective efforts.

# Conclusion

The "Open Problems in Longevity" project is a significant step forward in longevity science. By bridging knowledge gaps and fostering inclusive scientific exchange, we aim to accelerate progress in understanding aging.
