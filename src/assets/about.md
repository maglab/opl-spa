# About the Longevity Knowledge App

The **Longevity Knowledge App** is a dedicated platform for exploring and addressing the most pressing challenges in ageing and longevity science. Born from the need to foster collaboration and innovation in this rapidly evolving field, our project compiles, organises, and presents **100 open problems** in the current field of ageing and longevity.

## Aims

We aim to:

- Highlight unanswered questions in longevity science.
- Facilitate collaboration by connecting researchers, ideas, and resources.
- Provide an interactive and accessible resource for both scientists and the public.

## How It Began

This project was shaped by contributions from the scientific community through an open submission platform and a collaborative conference with ageing experts. Each problem was rigorously refined and validated using a combination of community input, manual collaboration as well as natural language processing.

## What You'll Find

On our platform, you can:

- **Explore** the 100 open problems, organised into thematic categories such as ageing mechanisms, biomarkers, interventions, and more.
- **Contribute** by submitting your own ideas or proposing solutions to existing challenges.

## Why It Matters

Longevity science seeks to address one of the most fundamental challenges in biology: understanding the mechanisms of ageing and developing interventions to improve both lifespan and healthspan. By identifying and prioritising these open problems, we aim to guide research efforts, bridge knowledge gaps, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. Addressing these challenges is essential to unlocking breakthroughs that could redefine the way we approach ageing and age-related diseases.
